# Log Message for Major Project for Week 4
## What was your goal for the past week?
My goal for last week was to calibrate a controller and have it work properly for all games.
## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
I did not manage to get my hands on a controller due to outside circumstances, so instead I spent my time finding and downloading more ROMS.
## What did you learn this week?
This week, I did not learn that much aside from up to what game console the raspberry pi can run up to without modification.
## What is your goal for next week?
My goal for next week is the same as last week's. To calibrate a controller and troubleshoot the controls until it works with little to no problems.
## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
The main challenges for next week are also unchanged. I run the possiblility of a modern controller not working. Each console may have the requirement of it's corresponding controller.
