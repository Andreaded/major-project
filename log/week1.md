# Log Message for Major Project for Week 1
## What was your goal for the past week?
The goal was to establish the base code of the program and make sure it could read files. The program is now able to read each text file and assign each line to an array. In addition, the user can now freely input any value. The program will check for input mismatches and just give the user an error while continuing to loop as opposed to just crashing. In addition, the program now only has one end: once the user chooses to mix the drink, the program will end. In any other case, the program will continue to run and the user can input ingredients as they choose.
## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
Yes, the program works with no bugs and will catch all errors.
## What did you learn this week?
I learned that Java does not have a function to add an item to an array. Memory must first be allocated, and then by using a specific number, the item must be assigned to a specific spot as opposed to just adding an item to the end of the array.
## What is your goal for next week?
My goal for next week is to finish writing the recipe book, drink descriptions and allow the program to detect which drink is being made.
## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
In order to detect which drink is being made, a line of a text must be converted to a string, and then from there that string must divide each word into a double value. After t hat, it can compare the user inputs with the possible outcomes.
