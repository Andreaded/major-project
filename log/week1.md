# Log Message for Major Project for Week 1
  This first week was actually really productive. What I accomplished this week was completing the base design and functionality of the game. I kept the look very simple since my main audience is going to be my older family members who remember the game in its classic monochromatic color scheme. I started with the functionality of the ball. I had to make it move horizontally and vertically and stay within the confines of the window. This was simply accomplished using multiple if statements to change the speed of the ball from x to -x and y to -y when it hit the width and/or the height of the canvas. I then started drawing and adding the functionality of the left paddle. I had to make it move up and down by using the 'w' and 's' keys, respectively. This was accomplished by drawing a rectangle and positioning it on the left side of the canvas and adding some key presses and release voids. Once I added vertical confines to the paddle, since it does not move left or right, my job with drawing and adding basic function to the left paddle was done. All I had to do for the right paddle was duplicate the same code I used to draw and confine the left paddle but switch a couple x and y values to position it on the right side. 
  
  After that it was all about the collision between the ball and the paddles. I had to use a slightly more complex formula to make sure that when the ball hit either paddle the x value of the ball's movement would flip to negative x. Same thing when it reached the paddle on the other side of the window. The formula looked like this: _if(x - w/2 < padLX + padLW/2 && y - h/2 < padLY + padLH/2 && y + h/2 > padLY - padLH/2) {
    if(speedX < 0)_ 
    If I had not put this last part in then the ball would get caught behind the paddle and keep bouncing between the paddle and the adjacent wall. I thought it was an interesting mechanic but gave up on the idea of a 'hold' mechanic and moved on after fixing it. Once this was done I added some integers for scores for each player and displayed them with an enlarged font on each respective side of their screen. Then I added a command to add one point to the score which is the code displayed here: 
    _if(x > width - w/2) {
    setup();//Resets to initial setup
    speedX = -speedX;
    scoreL = scoreL + 1;
  }
  else if ( x < 0 + w/2) {
    setup();//Resets to initial setup
    scoreR = scoreR + 1;
  }_ 
    This adds a point when the ball hits either side of the screen.
    
  The last part was the game over screen. I added a seperate set of voids for the game over page that would reset the ball to the center of the screen when someone scored a point. After that the easiest way to add a game over screen was to set an integer for the maximum number of points either player can achieve then set up a certain screen that would pause the game and display a game over message. The message disappears and the game resets if the player clicks the mouse. Overall I didn't expect to complete the largest portion so quickly but once I got the hang of the formulas and getting used to the properties of the bounce mechanics it was relatively simple to write out the score and pause screens. The hardest part was definitely the bouncing mechanic when the ball hits the paddles because not only does the ball have to bounce off the paddles but it has to _only_ bounce when it hits a paddle. Once interaction I noticed was that when I wrote the inital bouncing code the ball would bounce once x < a certain coordinate relating to the rectangle. All I had to do was write a line of code to recongize the height of the rectangle.  
  
  Among all this I also experimented with some new organizational techniques such as writing everything into their own voids to group the code better. It worked out really well and the draw function looked a lot cleaner than my other projects so I was happy with it. 
    
## What was your goal for the past week?
  My goal for this week was to write the basic functionality and design into the program. This was the largest chunk of the project so I'm glad I got it done quickly and efficiently. With a little but of testing and guess and check any problems were quickly resolved. I encountered a couple glitches within the game that were pretty quick to solve. I initally thought that writing in both paddles would be the longest portion of the code for this week but was pleasantly surprised when I figured out all I had to do was duplicate the code and change the x values and move it to the right side of the screen. 
  
 I went a bit overboard and completed one of my bonus challenges by adding a game over screen and score system. I was thinking about the game over screen while writing out the score system so I started it. Once I wrote everything into its own void and passed a string for text I figured I could just write out some text in the middle of the screen and reset the ball's position and speed to 0 then add a mouse press to reset the game. The score system was a matter of adding a point to an integer once the ball hit the edge of the screen and reset.  

## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
  I did accomplish this week's goal and much more. Using some online tutorials and a few suggestions from forums and some brainpower I got over the biggest hurdle which was the math for the movement and bounce/collision mechanics of the ball and paddles. I also solved my first hard problem of getting the ball to recognize the height and position of the paddle so that the ball wouldn't bounce off of random points where the paddle actually wasn't placed. I also kept things very simple for this project because I knew I would have a limited amount of time before it was due for completion and it made things a lot easier to wrap my head around. That and the new organizational techniques provided a lot of clarity when writing the code. 
  
  I also completed one of my bonus challenges and wrote a game over screen and score system already. Once I started writing out the code it surprised me as to how simple it actually was. It was probably one of the shorter pieces of code I had to write and was relatively simple to implement. I was happy with the fluency of the pause screen and game reset upon pressing the mouse button. Overall it looks nice and polished and I am happy with the results so far. 

## What did you learn this week?
  This week I learned and mastered the movement of objects and using keys to move objects within the confines of the window. 
I also learned how to write out formulas that helped the ball bounce off the paddles and recognize the position of the paddles so that it would only bounce when it hit a paddle. I also learned how to write out a simple score system measured with integers when the ball hits a certain side of the screen. This also came with learning how to write a game over screen and pause the game and write a maximum score as to when the game is over and resets. I also looked up some information on timers for the next challenge I will face next week.

## What is your goal for next week?
  My goal for next week is to add modifiers to the game. I brainstormed some ways to add modifiers to the game and thought that modifying the game based on the number of times the ball hits a paddle would be something I could implement. Upon further thought I now realize that this would be a lot more complex to implement than a simple time limit which is what I will be going with instead. Some modifiers I will add will be increased ball speed for a certain amount of time and then it will return to normal. After more time the paddles fill color will change and become nearly invisible for a short amount of time. Then both modifiers will be added at the same time. This will all be within one round however so the players will have to be very good at rallying the ball back and forth.

## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
  The main challenges will be implementing the timer. On a previous project implementing a timer based on when the program starts was the simplest way of doing it but adding a conditional timer proved very difficult to add. This time around I have a lot more time to think and implement it so I should be able to get it done. Then adding in certain conditions to the timer such as speed of the ball and fill color of the rectangles will be another challenge. I think I know how to start with this challenge but it will be difficult at first for sure.
