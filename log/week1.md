# Log Message for Major Project for Week 1
## What was your goal for the past week?
From the official Retro Pie website (https://retropie.org.uk/download/) , I was to follow the instructions to install Retro Pie onto the Raspberry pi. Using the terminal, I verified that the system had the proper requirements to install Retro Pie. Some of the default language options were not set, so I had to use ```sudo update-locale``` to make sure that there was input in the field. Following that, I cloned the repository from github and ran ``` cd RetroPie-Setup
chmod +x retropie_setup.sh
sudo ./retropie_setup.sh```
to execute the script. In the prompt that showed up, I just selected the quick install option. After it was finished, I ran the program to find that it worked.
## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
Yes, Retro pie is on the Raspberry pi and emulation station can be run.
## What did you learn this week?
I learned that the Raspberry pi cannot run wii games. Despite this, I was still surprised that it could run n64 games. I did not realise how poweful the Raspberry Pi was.
## What is your goal for next week?
My goal for next week is to install roms onto the raspberry pi and test them to see if they work.
## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
The main challenges are to find games and to port them onto the raspberry pi.
