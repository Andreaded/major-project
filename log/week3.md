# Log Message for Major Project for Week 3
## What was your goal for the past week?
My goal for the past week was to fix any bugs in the code that happened before I presented it for marking. I also wanted some feedback from my peers/family for how the game runs. Overall the reviews were positive and people were very receptive to the changes I made to the game. People liked the change of making the paddles dark for a moment to make the game more difficult. 

There was one bug that sat in the back of my mind and eventually made itself known when I realized that the millis timer was accumulative instead of conditional. I was trying to think of a way to fix it and after some assistance from my instructor I managed to make the timer conditional with a new method of expressing the timer that I had previously not known. 

## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
Last week's goal was all about feedback and peer review with intent to also fix any glaring mistakes in my code. I would say that I accomplished my goals for the last week because the game was well recieved and the main bug in the code for the millis timer was resolved. Everything still works fluidly so I am very pleased with the results of the peer review and feedback.

The game does what it is supposed to do. It was meant to remind people of an older generation of the game that first came out when computers were starting to become more mainstream in their household. For newer players it is a simple arcade game that can kill time and is very portable since it can be stored on a raspberry pi. The changes I added to the game seem to help in keeping the game interesting for newer players while keeping the game fresh and surprising for the older audience.  I am pleased that the game appeals to both demographics.

## What did you learn this week?
This week I learned how to present a project that I made to a variety of audiences and how both audiences recieved the game. I also learned that my initial millis timer was pretty archaeic in the sense that it was a basic way to implement a modification into the game. Both aspects of making a game that I learned this week were instrumental in perfecting the gameplay and modifying it to suit the playerbase. As this is a simple game it is very easy to make changes to bugs in the code for how very little there are. I can see the difference in difficulty if I were to make a large scale game and I look forward to pursuing a career in game development. This was a small test to see if I would have the drive to do this job and I am already wanting more. 

I learned how to fix the bug in the code for the millis timer by making the timer conditional between two sets of times rather than the timer just hitting a certain point and accumulating. For example: *if((duration > 10000 && duration < 15000)||(duration > 50000 && duration < 65000))*
This code makes the millis timer only work between these two conditions; if the timer is between 10 and 15 seconds or if the timer is between 50 and 65 seconds. What happens when the timer hits these two points is that it changes the mode from the regular setup to a "blind mode" that changes the color of the paddles and adds a small outline. In reality it just draws a second paddle but the difference isn't noticable as the framerate is too high to see the second set of paddles. After the timer runs out the second set of rendered paddles is removed and the regular setup continues. 

## What is your goal for next week?
My goal for next week is to present my totally finished product to my peers once again to guage reactions to the completely finished pong game that I made. I might also find a way to change how the blind mode functions at its most practical level. Currently there is a second set of paddles that renders on top of the first set. While there is no visible difference to someone who doesn't know the code it is a bit redundant to have two sets of paddles that render at once while blind mode is active. One way I could see it working is going through the draw function and interrupting the initial paddles being drawn by having a variable for them both to be flipped between a *'true' 'false'* switch. 

## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
My main challenges will be fixing any new bugs that present themselves without and further direction from an instructor. I do feel that I have learned all I need to that allows me to be profficient at processing so I believe that with any rational thought I can solve any problem that presents itself. An easy example would be the blind mode issue. 

With two sets of paddles being rendered at the same time it leads to redundancy and could potentially lead to memory issues going down the line. With the aforementioned *'true' 'false'* switch I could write an if statement that takes the switch and changes the variable to false for the first set of paddles in "regular" mode. The game will then render the second set of paddles for *blind mode* alone. Then have the variable switched to true once the timer runs out. Shouldn't be difficult to implement. It would also help with fluidity to the game and make it look more professional and clean in the code.
