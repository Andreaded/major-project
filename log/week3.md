# Log Message for Major Project for Week 3
## What was your goal for the past week?
My goal for last week was to check for and fix bugs.
## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
Yes, after extensive bug testing, all exceptions have been caught and it is impossible, from my experience, to bug out the program. From running through, I could only find one bug that I quickly fixed by removing one line of code.
## What did you learn this week?
I learned that while the scanner function .nextInt() and .nextDouble() works, .nextString() does not work.
