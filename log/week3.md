# Log Message for Major Project for Week 3
## What was your goal for the past week?
My goal was to fix the two errors. One being a syntax error like this. TicTacToe.java:3: error: '{' expected public class Tic-Tac-Toe. Another was to be able to change turns and fix any other errors so that the game at least works properly. 
## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
I was able to accomplish my goal. I was able to do this with the help of my teacher which allowed me to solve the errors. He showed me the way to make the code to check my board simpler which also was able to solve the errors and allowed the game to work properly.
## What did you learn this week?
I learned a simpler way to check the tic tac toe board if someone had won.
## What is your goal for next week?
There is no class next week.
## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
There are no challenges.
