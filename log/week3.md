# Log Message for Major Project for Week 3
## What was your goal for the past week?
My goal for the past week was to calibrate a controller to function for games. Since I did not have a controller at that time, I used the keyboard to substitute temporarily.
## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
In some ways, yes. I mananged to bind the keys to a managable one on the keyboard, but it only worked for some games. For early generation games, the keyboard worked fine even if the controls were a little janky at times. On top of this, I also installed some games that were famous during their time and even today. 
## What did you learn this week?
For this week, I learned that the keyboard does not work for late generation consoles because those consoles involved a joystick in their controller. The keyboard does not work for games on those consoles because it lacks the joystick capabablities, required.
## What is your goal for next week?
My goal for next week is to have a controller that can function properly for all platforms.

## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
The main challenge is the question of whether or not I need a specialized controller. It may be possible that each of the 64 bit consoles require their corresponding controller to play.
