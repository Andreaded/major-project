# Log Message for Major Project for Week 5
## What was your goal for the past week?
My goal for last week was to find a controller that worked for all games.

## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
Yes, I did. Today I brought a liscensed controller and it worked for all platforms including n64. At first, the controller was being detected but it was unable to function due to the latest update for the xpad drivers not working. By adding a line of code, I was able to calibrate the controller.

## What did you learn this week?
This week, I learned that the most recent update for retropi has controller drivers that don't work. I also learned that the drivers were specifcally made for controllers that were distrubuted along with the orginal console, so 3rd party controllers won't work.

## What is your goal for next week?
My goal for next week is to have a presentation ready and for the retro pi program to work with no flaws.

## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
My main challenge next week is maintaining the controller settings. It may be possible that the code will reset, so I will have to make sure that it doesn't.
