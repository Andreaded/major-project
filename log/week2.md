# Log Message for Major Project for Week 2
## What was your goal for the past week?
My goal for the past week was to install games on the rasperry pi and move them into RetroPie's rom folder. Because I did not have a usb flash drive, I decided to use github to transfer games onto the raspverry pi. By using the ```git clone``` command on the raspberry pi terminal I cloned the repository with the games on it and them moved the games into their respective folder. First, I tried to install 3 n64 games, but soon discovered that keyboard input was not valid within the game. Secondly, I installed an NES game, which worked fine for keboard.
## Did you accomplish last weekâ€™s goal? Why/why not?
I would say that I did accomplish last week's goal. The games can run with few errors and the controls (for the NES game) were solid enough to be playable.
## What did you learn this week?
I learned that individual roms have their own keybindings. For example, while the emulation station software is able to bind keys on the keyboard to mimic a controller, these keybinds still do not register for games that require a special controller, such as n64. My suspiscion is that because these games require a joystick to play, the keyboard is set to not register because the game is not optimized to handle key inputs where joystick controls would normally apply.
## What is your goal for next week?
My goal for next week would be to correctly calibrate a controller that fits the needs of all games or find out which controller will suffice.
## What are the main challenges you are facing next week?
The main challenge next week is controller input. I will need to bring a usb controller that works and may even have to buy specialized controllers.
