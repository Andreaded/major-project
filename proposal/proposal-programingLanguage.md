# Working Title: Pong Redux
## Name of Lead Designer(s): Caleb Kryton  

## Materials & Methods
For this project I will be using the programming language known as Processing. While the actual coding will be done with this language I will also be using other tools such as youtube videos and processing forums to fill in the blanks for myself when it comes to the code for the game. These videos will serve as a general guideline of how my code should look and function. I will also be frequently using the processing.org reference page to learn new tools I can use or refresh my memory of the key functions within processing that I have learned already. As a personal reference I will also use an online version of pong to compare and contrast my game with an already completed project.

## Program Specifications
This project is a retro-style arcade game known as pong. An endless game where 2 players try to score a point on each other by bouncing a small square or ball shaped object to the other side of the screen. The whole program will revolve around bouncing a sqaure or ball shaped object between two rectangles to try and score a point, however, I will attempt to introduce other game mechanics in order to make the game more challenging. One example that I will attempt to introduce is increasing the speed of the ball after a certain number of bounces so that the game doesn't become stale after a few minutes. Another mechanic I will attempt to create is to limit the speed of the ball but turn the rectangles that the players use invisible for a certain amount of bounces or time. This "debuff", as it will be known, will be temporary. The purpose of it will be to introduce a new difficulty mechanic to test the player. The rectangles will become visible again after a period of time or a threshold of bounces is reached but the speed of the ball will increase until the players can't move fast enough to catch it and a point is scored. The game is simple enough that these mechanics will be easy to introduce but the variety will be low enough so that people who aren't good at video games will not be deterred from playing it. The idea is to seperate people who are not so good at pong versus the people who are. Good players who take the game more seriously will begin to play a different style that introduces new mechanics to make it more fun for seasoned veterans while people who dont play games will experience the same pong that they know and love and it will be good for nostalgic purposes.

## Potential Challenges
I can already see the potential challenges with incorporating new mechanics as I will have to do it from scratch and start gaining more experience with modifiers. Not only that but I will have to segment them so that the game has some variety. The best way to solve these problems will be to think out the code logically and using a step-by-step method to guess and check the correct way to implement the mechanics. Another challenge will be fluidity of the program. I have to make sure the program runs flawlessly as it will improve the feeling that the player will have and the enjoyment they will get. This will just come down to constant test runs and bug fixing until the code works as intended. If I am unable to solve a problem I will find a new way to incorporate it or look up a tutorial of how to fix it. Another solution is possibly to ask for help on a processing forum for some outside knowledge that my peers cannot provide. The general idea of the mechanics and the game are not too difficult so I do believe that any challenge will have a pretty simple fix. There shouldn't be any reason a problem cannot be solved when it comes to this program.

## Time Line
* Week 1: Basic design and functionality of the rectangles and potentially the ball will be the objective of this week. I.e. moving the rectangles withing a confined area and making sure the ball can reflect off of the walls and the player controlled rectangles. The basic design of the game will also be completed by this week.

* Week 2: Modifiers and new mechanics will be the objective of this week. I imagine that most of it will be testing to see if the proposed mechanics will be introduced without issues and setting the thresholds of bounces and/or time gates before a new mechanic gets introduced. 

* Week 3: Additional design and bug fixing. At this point I want to have the functionality complete and general design finished. The only thing I will be doing is most likely adding some small designs such as a menu screen or initial text to the game to make it look a little more polished and fixing any problems the game has while running. I will also assess if there is time to create a pause function. If not then it won't be added at all.

# Evaluation
## 60%
For a 60% evaluation the basic design and functionality will need to be completed. The ball will have to be able to be bounced between the two fully functional player controlled rectangles and will have to be able to bounce within the walls of the canvas. If the ball hits the east or west walls the game will be reset to a new round.
## 80%
The new modifiers will need to be fully incorporated into the base game. The ball will need to be able to move faster after a certain time period and after an even longer amount of time the player controlled rectangles will need to turn invisible (simply by changing fill color to match the background). They will also need to revert to their normal color after a minute or two.

## 90+%
Some sort of menu or initial menu screen before you play the game needs to be implemented. Either a screen on its own or a simple text command overlaying the game saying "Press _x_ button to start."
