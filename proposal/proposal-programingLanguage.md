## Materials & Methods
I will be working with Retro Pie. I will install this over the current operating system, raspian. In addition I will require an internet connection to install the software initially an a flash drive to easily transport ROMS into the game folder.

## Program Specifications
_Fully describe your project below in one paragraph (minimum 5 sentences). Is it a game? A tool? If it is a game, what game genre is it?_
RetroPie is a software for raspian that allows the raspberry pi to emulate games. The program can run games from the dreamcast console and anything before that. My goal is to run games for n64; I think anything that was released after that require additional modification and funding. The software will be installed onto raspbian and include Emulation Station and RetroArch. I am mainly making this project for personal use.
## Potential Challenges
_Potential challenges. What are some of the challenges you think you will have to solve? How are you planing to solve them? What will you do if you are unable to solve some challenges?_
One of the main problems is controller calibration. While I do have a controller, it may be hard to calibrate the button to fit the needs of each console. This is not too bad of an issue because I could always use the keyboard. Another one would be finding games. Finding roms on legitimate websites will be next to impossible, so I may have to dig deep to find them.

## Time Line
_Describe in detail what you will complete by the end of each week (end of Friday class)._
* Week 1:Install RetroPie onto Raspberry Pi
* Week 2:Find game ROMS and install
* Week 3:Test games and calibrate controllers 
* Week 4:Organize data
* Week 5:Patch anything that is needed
