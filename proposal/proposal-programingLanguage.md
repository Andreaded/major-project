# Working Title: The W Dashboard
## Name of Lead Designer(s): Jacob Liddicoat

* Theme/Look: A gray weather dashboard.

## Materials & Methods
_What programing language will you be using? If you are not planing to use Processing explain why you chose a different programing language._
I will be using processing.
## Program Specifications
_Fully describe your project below in one paragraph (minimum 5 sentences). Is it a game? A tool? If it is a game, what game genre is it?_
 It is a tool to find weather data. The weather dashboard will display the weather of the city that I choose. The data will include stuff like wind speed and humidity. The data from the website will use jsonobjects to get the weather into processing. From there floats, strings and images will give the data variables and then print the data. 
## Potential Challenges
_Potential challenges. What are some of the challenges you think you will have to solve? How are you planing to solve them? What will you do if you are unable to solve some challenges?_
The challenge would be getting the link and the jsonobjects to work. I am planning to solve it by making sure the link is correct and I have enclosed it properly. If I am unable to solve it I will have to get the link from a different website.
## Time Line
_Describe in detail what you will complete by the end of each week (end of Friday class)._
* Week 1: Pitch
* Week 2: Proposal and Week 1 log and add weather info.
* Week 3: Fix errors in project such as the link.
* Week 4:Finish Project
* Week 5:Debugging

The minimum expectations will be that the link will work but only one or two varables work.
## 80%
_What does 80% look like?   List some specific features of your project that are needed to reach 80%._
The specific features will be where all the weather variables work.
## 90+%
_What does 90+% look like?   List some specific features of your project that are needed to reach 90+%._
The specific features will be where the weather changes when I give it a different city.
