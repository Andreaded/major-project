* Theme/Look:

## Materials & Methods
I will be using Nano to write the program with Java. I will also be using a markdown file to store predetermined values.

## Program Specifications
The program will have the user mix a combination of ingredients, and potentially get a predetermined drink after running the program. The drinks will be stored on a markdown file and the user will potentially be able to look at a guide book within the program.
## Potential Challenges
Getting the program to read a markdown file and apply the correct information may be a problem. While I have done this in the past, I do not have a method to read markdown files that I know for sure works.

## Time Line
* Week 1: Write base program, implement user input and most functionality
* Week 2: Add information to database, get program to read markdown files
* Week 3: Bug testing and fixing

# Evaluation
## 60%
Program can run without errors and user input works fine

## 80%
Program can detect user input and respond accordingly 

## 90+%
Program can run perfectly and also includes a built in guide book
