# README : proposal

After the pitch students are required to reflect on the feedback they recieved from peers and from their teacher and use these as the basis for their project proposal. The project proposal needs to following questions:

1. Describe, in detail, your final product. What are the mechanics of your product (e.g. game mechanics, web site structure and content, etc). For example, if you are building a game your description has to include the specifics of how the game will work, who is playing against who, levels, score keeping, graphics etc. If you are making a website your description has to include specifics on what the website will contain, a site map, hosting plans, source of content etc.

1. Describe, in detail, what your goals are for each week (end of class on Fridays). Your goals have to include a description of the deliverables for each week (i.e. what are you going to show your teacher). Be as specific as possible. Your mark for each week will be based on if you reached the weekly goal you set for yourself.

1. Explain in detail the tools you will use to make your project. Does your project involve programing? If if does, what programing language/markup language will you use? Are you able to include the source code in git and GitHub? If not, why not? Is you code readable in a text editor? If not, what software is required to view it?

1. Potential challenges. What are some of the challenges you think you will have to solve? How are you planing to solve them? What will you do if you are unable to solve some challenges?
