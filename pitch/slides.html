# Name: Caleb Kryton
# Project Title: Pong Redux

---

# What
* Creating a 2d game in processing.
* Create Pong in processing. A game where 2 bars move along the edge of each side of the screen to block a small square.
* Basically computerized table tennis without the net. Purpose to score a point by letting the square pass through the other bar.
* Square can bounce around the screen and be reflected to the opponent.
---

# Why
* I have a large interest in game development and this is a good way to get started.
* Very simple type of game and will give me a fundamental understanding of how to create and manage a game.
* I want to be a game developer as well so this will provide a good project as part of my portfolio.

---

# How
* Online [youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsZmuEEHcbU&feature=youtu.be&list=PLf5zPS-STiK8JoDStTZFnYsjoJ61Ssa4I) and forum tutorials
* [Online version of pong](http://www.ponggame.org/) as a reference for how the game should look and function.
* Use teacher as a reference if I don't understand certain aspects of the code needed.
* Code the game in processing and periodic testing/debugging.
* Use the [processing.org reference page](https://processing.org/reference/) for language and syntax.
---

# Success
* Introduce to peers and family members.
* Get feedback and reactions from peers and family members.
* Eventual poject grade.
* Throw in as part of a tournament if possible.
