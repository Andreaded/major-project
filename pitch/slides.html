# Name: Mostafa Rizk
# Project Title: Tic-tac-toe

---

# What

Create a Tic-tac-toe game where a player can play against the computer. A 3x3 grid system is drawn using ASCII to help the player visualize their moves. The solving algorithm should make the computer opponent unable to lose.

---

# Why

To test out what I have learned from this course, as well as try to expand on my knowledge. This project combines aspects and learned skills from previous projects, as well as new skills that will be developed to complete this project.

---

# How

Using knowledge and experience from previous projects, the assistance of Mr. Pineda, as well as online resources, I will adapt the information I have available to suit the project that I'm developing.

---

# Success

This will be defined by how elegant my solution to the presented problem is. How effectively will the code run, how often will the computer opponent win or tie, and whether my solution can be scaled up to deal with larger problems. The goal is not to solve the problem, but to solve it well.
