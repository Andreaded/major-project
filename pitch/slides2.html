# Name: Alexander Yang
# Project Title: Virtual Bartender

# What
User will be able to add a select amount of ingredient to a mixer, and create a drink. They will be able to decide the amount of number of ingredients being entered and create a drink from a predetermined list. If the proportions of ingredients is correct, they may create a specific drink. If no pre-set combinations are found for the ingredients input, the program will either determine that the user has made a mess or a more generic drink.

# Why
Personal interest. With the limitations of the hardware, designing graphics in Java is near impossible, but I would still like to explore developement of games, albeit less interactive and text based. Working around hardware limitations, I want to design a game that still holds novelty and can be considered a game.
---

# How
Using java, a database of information will be made and the program will choose an option that most accurately fits with the user input.
---

# Success
I will measure my success based on how accurate the program can determine the outcome runs and if it works properly without any issues.
