# README : CSE1910 - CSE Project A

## Expectations
In this assignment you will use project-based learning to connect and extend your previous learning in computer science. Take this assignment as a learning experience, not an easy grade. Your success will suffer if you do not sincerely pursue a project that interests you.

## Project Selection
While you have freedom in selecting your project based on your interests (i.e. you have lots of freedom when choosing a project) your project has to fullfill the following criteria in order to be approved:

* You must be passionate about your project
* Result in a final product (software, hardware, digital resource, etc.) 
* You must able to acces it at school every day for the rest of the class (physically and/or virtually)
* Connect to topics and concepts covered in Computer Science 10
* Using git and GitHub for source control management
* Cannot consist of only binaries
* Legal to develop and use 
* Must be safe to you and to the users

## Collaborative Projects
Collaborative projects are approved on an invididual basis and require all the students in the group to have shown mastery of git/GitHub concepts and workflow. 

## Evaluation
The following components of the major project are evaluated:

1. Pitch (10%)
2. Proposal (10%)
3. Log entries and source control management (50%)
4. Presentation (20%)
5. Final product (10%)

## Project Suggestions
While you are free to choose a project that you are keep on pursuing, here are some suggestions to guide you if you need some suggestions.
