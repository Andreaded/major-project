# major-project

**The major project is worth 1 full credit.**

## Expectations
In this assignment you will use project-based learning to connect and extend your previous learning in computer science. Take this assignment as a learning experience, not an easy grade. Your success will suffer if you do not sincerely pursue a project that interests you.

## Project Selection
While you have freedom in selecting your project based on your interests your project has to fullfill all the following criteria:
* Result in a final product(s) (software, website etc).
* You must able to access it at school every day (physically and/or virtually)
* Connect to topics and concepts covered in class 
* Using git and GitHub for source control management
* Legal and safe to develop and use 

## Collaborative Projects

## Evaluation
The following components of the major project are evaluated with the folowing weights:
1. Pitch (10%)
2. Proposal (10%)
3. Log entries and source control management (50%)
4. Presentation (20%)
5. Final product (10%)
