# major-project

**The major project is worth 1 full credit.**

## Expectations
In this assignment you will use project-based learning to connect and extend your previous learning in computer science. Take this assignment as a learning experience, not an easy grade. Your success will suffer if you do not sincerely pursue a project that interests you.

## Project Selection
While you have freedom in selecting your project based on your interests your project has to fullfill all the following criteria:
* Result in a final product(s) (software, website etc).
* You must able to access it at school every day (physically and/or virtually)
* Connect to topics and concepts covered in class 
* Using git and GitHub for source control management
* Legal and safe to develop and use 

## Collaborative Projects
Collaborative projects are not permitted.

## Evaluation
The following components of the major project are evaluated with the folowing weights:
1. Pitch (10%)
2. Proposal (10%)
3. Log entries and source control management (50%)
4. Presentation (20%)
5. Final product (10%)

## How to start...
Start by forking this repository.

## Keeping up to date with the master repository
To keep your local assignment repository up to date with your teacher's repository you need follow the following procedure from the terminal (shell in Linux and Git Shell in the Windows GitHub client).

**Step 1:** The first time you are updating your repository you need to run the following command:
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mariopineda/CSE1910-CSE-Project-A
```
**Step 2:** If you are using the same computer you do not have to do Step 1 in subsequent updates and you can skip right to Step 2. In this step you need to run the following two commands:
```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
```
**Step 3:** Resolve possible merge conflicts and commit.

**Step 5:** You local repository has now been updated using your teacher's master respository. Finally you need to push your local repository to GitHub to make sure that your GitHub repository is updated as well.

## Building Web Pages
This repository has been set up with a web page template. To access the source code for the web page template you need to change the current working branch to the gh-pages. You can access the web site through the browser at http://mariopineda.github.io/CSE1910-CSE-Project-A/.
